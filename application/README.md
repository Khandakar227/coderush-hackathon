Gonna finish this project
1. There will be a v2
2. Gonna use html's contenteditable attribute
3. Gonna use resize handler (pkg: react-resize-detector)
4. Gonna add a feature of react-draggable.
5. CSS attributes (font, color, background etc) editing system will be added.
6. undo redo feature (pkg: use-undo-redo).

Undo Feature:
So far I have implemented a stack fr undo and redo. now function also works (almost). Now onDragEnd selector gives me child element not the element I am dragging. This should be fixed.
